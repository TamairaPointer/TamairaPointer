- 👋 Hi, I’m @TamairaPointer
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics and science have always been interests of mine because I want to know how everything works and how we can make this world a better place.
- 🌱I'm currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I am open to collaborative projects with startups because I think it's important to start somewhere. When it comes to learning, we are never done; there is always more to explore. So let's venture into the unknown and see what we can achieve together....
